AskJeeves was acquired by [IAC](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/IAC) in March 2005 for $1.85 Billion and renamed Ask.com in 2006.

In July 2010, Ask.com returned to its Q&A roots with the beta launch of its question and answer (Q&A) offering that uses a hybrid of search technology and human response to address complex or opinion-based questions. The company also launched it flagship mobile application (since downloaded more than 3 million times) in the fall of 2010. 

In 2012, Ask.com made two acquisitions as part of a larger strategy to offer more content on the Ask.com website. On July 2, 2012 Ask.com purchased content discovery start-up, nRelate, for an undisclosed amount. That was followed by the company's acquisition of expert advice and information site About.com, which closed in September 2012

Ask.com's ads are served by Google.

Since the Internet is more than two decades old, doesn't it seem strange that the typical way to save something online is to put it into an email or a document? We think so too, which is why we built an easy and powerful tool to help you.

All of this may sound simple, but we think it's actually quite significant. We believe that someday soon everyone will be saving and organizing their online life in a way that is easy, fun and reflective of themselves. It is a world where everyone is highly engaged and active in saving their life experiences online.

The company relaunched their product in January 2007 with enhanced sharing capabilities and a free 1GB version meant to entice users who are not ready to pay $55 per year for unlimited storage. The company found that the first version of its service didn't make it easy enough for its 11,000 paying members to share their hosted media with each other. Sharing usually had to be done by manually emailing password-protected links to family and friends. These emails would get lost, and with them, the URLs and passwords contained within.

The new version of Phanfare addresses this issue by integrating social networking functionality that enables users to create connections with one another and specify which content they want to make available to their Phanfare contacts. The photo sharing capabilities are very similar to Facebook's, although users have more control on who sees which particular content.

Phanfare also allows users to store photos and videos in a application on the desktop. It then syncs the media automatically with the web. Currently, this desktop client is only available for the PC but the company has been working on a version for the Mac as well. 

Akin to [SmugMug](http://www.smugmug.com/), Phanfare converts the videos to Flash allowing them to be easily viewed online; users can also download them in their original form. There is also no Phanfare Facebook application or iPhoto plugin, but these too may be available in the future.

Felix revolutionizes local advertising by offering the first Pay Per Action phone call product to local businesses. Instead of paying for clicks or phone calls, a business only pays for potential customers. The way Felix does this is deceptively simple and hides enormous complexity from the tens of thousands of local businesses. Felix utilizes over 200 different advertising relationships to place business clients in premiere spots whenever a consumer is looking for a local provider.  Felix also deeply inspects the value of each advertising buy it makes using its state of the art telephony analytics engine. Felix automatically transcribes and analyzes each phone call, then analyzes the call to ensure that it was really from a consumer interested in doing business with the client. 
 
The reporting mechanism for Felix provides a simple, intuitive breakdown of what's going on with each call. This reporting allows clients to easily measure returns with the services, as well as providing valuable information to help business owners train and improve customer service with their staff.

Scout Labs is a product company, not an agency. They provide cutting-edge technology and a collaborative platform for companies and their agents to listen to customers and engage with them out across the Internet. With Scout Labs, users can:

- Know when to tune in and whatâs most important to pay attention to
- Hear what customers love and hate about brands
- Reach out to influential customers to build relationships
- Engage in proactive customer service
- Let the voice of the customer inspire new product and marketing ideas

Scout Labs has grown significantly since it was founded in 2006. With offices in San Francisco and users all over the world, the company currently employs over 20 professionals. Their CEO and product team guide the application with insight from the world of marketing, brand management and product management, but the majority of Scout Labs employees are senior engineers with expertise in search technology, high-performance systems, natural language processing, machine learning, web crawling and data visualization.

The process is quite simple, and the user interface is streamlined. Brand managers start by creating concurrent searches for each brand they want to track. They can track just about anything people discuss: things, people, slogans, logos, etc. Subsequently, any mention of the brand is cataloged. Users can then see each blog post, video or image that has to do with the brand, and the interface shows how mentions increase and decrease over time. What sets Scout Labs apart is their ability to analyze each blog post. Their software decides if it is negative, positive or neutral towards the brand. They are also able to rank the source of the content to highlight more influential sources.

The company expanded tremendously in 1998 through the acquisition of a number of Internet and cable companies.

Then, beginning in 2005, management focused on RCNâs strategic Northeast Corridor and Chicago markets, selling non-core assets including its 49% stake in Megacable, the largest cable company in Mexico, as well as its West Coast assets.

With close to a decade of experience providing cable TV, Internet and phone service using fiber optics already under its belt, RCN again grew significantly in 2006. First, the company acquired Con Edison Communications (CEC), a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc., with its own fiber-optic network in New York City. The combination of CEC with RCNâs existing business services capability created the subsidiary RCN Business Solutions. Second, RCN completed a substantial network upgrade, including conversion to a 100% digital network.

In 2007, RCN Business Solutions acquired NEON Communications gaining an advanced fiber-optic network stretching across twelve northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. NEON was a wholesale service provider of high-bandwidth transport services to service providers and Fortune 100 companies. With this acquisition, RCN Business Solutions became RCN Metro Optical Networks, a leading facilities-based provider to medium and large carriers and enterprises in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Chicago metro area. 

RCN entered a new phase in 2008. Now equipped with two business units, Residential and Small Business and RCN Metro Optical Networks, serving three customer segments, the company continues to win customers in its markets. RCN is accelerating its movement to an all-digital video platform, enabling an increase in high-definition availability and improving picture quality to cable TV customers, and is continuing to offer the fastest high-speed Internet available with cable modem speeds that challenge industry standards.

Pliant EFDs are ideal for a range of data I/O (input/output) intensive enterprise applications, such as trading floors, financial transactions, VOD, airline reservation systems, e-commerce, and Web 2.0 applications.  

Pliantâs EFD is a disruptive solution that offers breakthrough performance and reliability improvements over todayâs highest performing hard drive and consumer solid state storage devices (SSD).  EFDs enable enterprise data centers to do âmuch more for lessâ â achieve more performance and reliability with less cost, energy and space.  One EFD can replace many (100+) enterprise HDDs (10K/15K RPM) for performance, and by combining EFDs with high capacity HDDs, todayâs storage racks can be reduced to storage shelves saving power (up to 80%), space and money. 

Based on an advanced software architecture and proprietary ASIC design, Pliantâs EFD changes the storage system paradigm while meeting growing âGreen ITâ energy efficiency.

It was clear to the founding directors that one of the most time-consuming processes undertaken by accountants was the re-keying of their small business clients bank statements into the practices own computer system.

It seemed logical that if this data was already recorded by the computer systems of financial institutions, it would be possible to transfer the data directly to the accountants computer systems.

Dialysis saves the lives of a growing number of patients every year, and innovation in the field is essential. The only current alternative to renal dialysis - kidney transplantation - is not an available option for most patients, due to a shortage of donor organs.

Metreos provided both packaged applications and a set of tools for designing, developing, deploying, and managing applications deployed on IP telephony networks. Their primary customer base were large enterprises who had invested significant capital in replacing aging [TDM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing) based phone systems with new [Voice-over-IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP) phone systems, specifically those who had chosen Cisco Systems as their VoIP vendor of choice.

Large Cisco customers began to use the Metreos product suite in 2004 with early deployments by Lehman Brothers and BearingPoint. Frustrated by the lack of support from their primary IP PBX vendor, Metreos customers were able to use the Metreos Communications Environment to customize their IP telephony deployment to their liking, often times implementing features that were lost in the transition from TDM to IP.

Recognizing that many of their large marque customers were using the Metreos product to enhance their Cisco deployment, Cisco purchased Metreos in June 2006 for $28 million USD.","ip-telephony, development-tools, cisco, voip, application-development",USA,TX,Austin,Austin,NA,NA,0,0,2003-03-20,2004-10-14,2,4355000,2005-02-01,2010-06-30,3,8,NA,2009-04-29T15:27:55Z,2013-04-07T11:39:05Z,28000000

We have no ownership ties to pharmacies, wholesalers, mail order services or other companies that dispense and sell medications. We make no money from favoring a certain pharmacy or promoting prescription sales.

Because we're privately held, we don't have to satisfy shareholders or chase quarterly earnings. This frees us to focus on long-term client partnerships that achieve strategic results -- like eliminating unnecessary costs from the health care system.

We believe in making a fair profit in a way that best profits our clients. In other words, succeeding on the right terms.

Our services include:

    Prescription claim processing for employers, managed healthcare plans, workers' compensation plans, HMOs, insurance companies, Medicaid, government plans, and unions
    Convenient pharmacy access through an independent network of more than 64,000 participating pharmacies

A pioneer in its industry, Autonomy's unique meaning-based technology is able to make sense of and process unstructured, 'human information,' and draw real business value from that meaning.

Human information makes up the vast majority of content in the world today and exists almost everywhere: in documents, emails, pictures, audio, video, and mobile and social media communications. Unlike tagging or keyword solutions, Autonomy uses ground-breaking, pattern-matching technology to form an understanding of this data, allowing computers to capture the meaning held within 100 percent of information, including structured, 'extreme,' or 'big data' amassed in databases from call detail records, gene sequencing, sensors, algorithmic trading, click streams, and other sources. Autonomy software helps businesses and organizations reduce complexity and unlock the real value in data.

Autonomy provides meaning-based solutions that understand the full spectrum of enterprise information as well as the relationships that exist within it. By enabling computers to comprehend the 'shades of grey' in our world, rather than only the black and white found in databases, businesses can automate processes, comply with regulations, act in real time, and improve business outcomes.

Understanding 100% of Information
The characteristic that makes human information unstructured is its form - it does not fit neatly into the rows and columns of a database, but exists in various formats including books, email messages, surveillance video, chat streams, and phone calls that occur across networks, the web, the cloud, and numerous mobile devices. Growing at a rate three times that of structured data, the increasing deluge of unstructured information makes up approximately 90 percent of all information. The challenge for the modern enterprise is to understand and extract value from this rich sea of human information.

Today, with Autonomy, organizations can now process and understand in real time, the meaning of 100 percent of information.

Phase Forward's technology and global services are designed to enable life sciences companies to automate and integrate the management of their entire clinical development process â from study initiation and FDA submission through post-marketing studies. 

Until its acquisition by [Oracle](/company/oracle) in April 2010, Phase Forward was a publicly held company. Its corporate headquarters are in Waltham, Massachusetts, international headquarters in Maidenhead, UK, and its regional offices in the U.S., Japan, France and Australia.

Phase Forward was founded in 1997 by Paul Bleicher, M.D, Ph.D., who had experienced firsthand the complexities involved in developing and conducting paper-based trials â in particular, capturing, managing, and growing volumes of data. Dr. Bleicherâs vision was to develop technology that would enable organizations to make the shift from paper-based methods to Internet-enabled solutions. His pioneering efforts have contributed significantly to Phase Forwardâs evolution from initial concept to its current industry-leading position.

Spearheading the evolution of electronic data capture (EDC) with its industry-leading InFormâ¢ solution, Phase Forward has transformed the way clinical data are collected, analyzed and managed.

TinyGrab was envisioned in April 2009 by British student Chris Leydon, whilst at Staffordshire University in the United Kingdom.

The first version of TinyGrab was limited to run only on the Mac OS X operating system. Soon after, TinyGrab expanded upon this by releasing an application that allowed users of Microsoft Windows to use the service. TinyGrab for iPhone was released on 26 May 2010 and is now available in the iTunes app store

In March 2010, TinyGrab was profiled in Macworld Magazine.

April 2010 saw the announcement of TinyGrab 2.0 with the beta launching in October 2010. TinyGrab 2.0 focuses on social screenshot sharing and is a complete overhaul of the system.

In May 2010, TinyGrab appealed to its users for help with funding the project in order to keep it alive. Later the same month they announced support from MacHeist and Rackspace.

TinyGrab was available for a short time through a MacHeist bundle at the end of 2009.

Unusually for a web based service, TinyGrab is entirely self funded by the two founding partners with no external source of funding, or investors.","screenshot-sharing, software, image-sharing, mobile-image-sharing",GBR,NA,Worcester,Worcester,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,0,0,2009-09-07,2010-11-15,3,5,NA,2009-09-07T05:56:44Z,2011-08-23T21:52:59Z,200000

Embolisation is commonly used to treat a number of conditions, including: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - liver cancer tumours, Uterine fibroids - benign hypervascularised tumours of the uterus, which can cause pain, bleeding and infertility, Varicose veins and Aneurysms.

An embolic agent is then administered in order to block blood flow to the area and seal in as much of the drug as possible (and prevent rapid washout of the drug).

In order to compete with other similar service providers, Spinvox has recently introduced some other features such as SpinVox Blog; it allows users speak a post to a blog from any phone. There is also the Memo service: users speak memos to themselves -- the messages subsequently get transcribed and sent as email reminders. Lastly, SpinVox users can speak a text message, update social networks, or send messages to groups of people at once using recepient lists.

SeaMicro has identified the primary drivers underlying power inefficiencies in servers and has systematically rectified these shortcomings. The result is a small form factor server that uses one-quarter of the power and requires only one-sixth of the space used by traditional servers. SeaMicro servers are plug-and-playthey require no changes to software operating systems, applications, or management infrastructure.

Every threat should be stopped long before it reaches you. MessageLabs was the first company in the world to introduce anti-virus as a service rather than software, delivered within the fabric of the Internet, that was able to stop threats long before they reached their intended targets, could learn from the huge volumes of messages being processed and was able to draw on far greater resources than would be possible within a single organization. The result was a truly revolutionary anti-virus service that gained worldwide recognition for stopping and naming the Lovebug virus hours before any other vendor heralding a new era in the industry.

Smart Grid Infrastructure

A smart grid infrastructure is the sum of services, devices and software necessary to add a layer of intelligence onto todayâs 20th-century electricity grid such that every point on that grid can talk to every other point and decisions are made either by devices or human beings to fully optimize the process by which electricity is generated and delivered to customers.

A smart grid infrastructure can spot and stop energy âleaks,â optimize efficiency through better power factors and provide feedback loops that provide the right price signals to normalize energy loads during peak use. According to the Pacific Northwest Laboratory in partnership with the Department of Energy, the total potential benefit of implementing smart grid technologies over the next 20 years is conservatively estimated to have a present value of $75 billion.

SmartSynch creates extraordinary value for our customers by providing innovative Smart Grid Infrastructure solutions that leverage public wireless networks.

Android has a large community of developers writing applications (""apps"") that extend the functionality of the devices. There are currently over 200,000 apps available for Android.

The unveiling of the Android distribution on 5 November 2007 was announced with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of 80 hardware, software, and telecom companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices.

We help consumer-facing brands or agencies capture relevant conversations on the real-time web and turn them into lasting, trusted customer relationships with new opportunities for revenue growth. 

JitterJam enables:
-	Social Media Monitoring: Enables brands to listen for and measure conversations about their products, markets and competitors
-	Community Development: Allows brands and companies to find the social communities in which their current and potential customers participate and start directly engaging those communities and individuals
-	Integrated Marketing: Develop rich social profiles on each contact in the JitterJam database and market to highly targeted segments with tailored messaging and offerings. See how JitterJam's full Social CRM shows proven return on social marketing investment

JitterJam is unique in that it encompasses and surpasses the capabilities of single-purpose social media and marketing tools and puts the consumer at the core of the marketing platform. JitterJam builds a social profile for each consumer.

Consumer databases are often just static email lists and are collected for specific campaigns. JitterJam unifies the consumer contact across email, mobile and social sphere and develops background intelligence on each contact's activities and interests. JitterJam's Make Me Happy[TM] permission marketing system enables each consumer to drive how they want to be contacted, how often they'd like communications from the business or brand, and what specific types of communications they'd like to receive. After the business has received explicit permission to market, the multi-channel communications platform enables deep segmentation of the consumer database for highly targeted marketing campaigns that result in deeper engagement and higher returns. Those returns are immediately measured and the results available through the JitterJam platform. This enables businesses to identify and target the most active and engaged individuals.

Originally inspired by [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendster), MySpace quickly grew to become the world's largest social network, before being overtaken by [Facebook](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook). User pages are highly customizable and support integration with widgets such as [Slide](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/slide) or [YouTube](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youtube). MySpace provides users with a way to connect around content and culture. 

MySpace was started as a side project of the internet marketing company eUniverse (now called [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia)) in August 2003. [Brad Greenspan](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-greenspan), then founder and CEO of eUniverse oversaw the project, which was also led by [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) (later CEO), [Josh Berman](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-berman), and [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson) (soon to be President). It officially launched in January 2004.

By February 2004, MySpace reached 1 million registered users. By November 2004, that number had reached 5 million. In July, 2005 [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) bought eUniverse (renaming it [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia)) for $580 M, of which approximately $327 M was the valuation of MySpace. At this time, the site had 20 million registered users. In mid 2007, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) contemplated selling 25% of MySpace stock to [Yahoo!](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/yahoo) in a deal that would have valued the site at $12 B, though this never went through. 

After being acquired, MySpace's revenues grew rapidly, as [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) pursued lucrative advertising deals. In August 2006, [Google](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google) made a $900 M agreement to provide search and advertising directly on the MySpace site, which is set to expire in June 2010.

In mid 2008, MySpace participated in a major site redesign. Throughout its history, critics have often cited the chaotic and disorganized interface as a severe drawback to usability of the site. This redesign made the main page more streamlined and clean.

In late 2006, [Universal Music Group](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/universal-music-group) sued MySpace for millions in damages from copyright infringement. This suit was settled in mid 2008 by the launch of [MySpace Music](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music), a site where users can listen to streaming songs from all sorts of artists. To supplement this venture, MySpace acquired [iLike](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ilike) in mid 2009. MySpace had previously also launched a record label in 2005 and musicians such as Lily Allen and Sean Kingston were first discovered through MySpace.

In mid 2007, MySpace acquired [PhotoBucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) for $250 M in cash, plus an additional $50 M earn-out. By late 2009, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) sold a 2/3 stake in [Photobucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) to a group of investors valuing the company at $60 M, over 80% less than the acquisition price.

Since 2008, user growth has stagnated and page views and other metrics have fallen. In April 2009, longtime CEO and co-founder [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) was replaced by [Owen Van Natta](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta), in a publicized firing. President and head of product, [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson), was kept on, but in a different position. Two months following this, MySpace announced it was laying off 30% of its workforce amounting to 420 people.

In June 2011, Myspace was acquired by Specific Media for a [reported US$35 million](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/myspace-goes-to-specific-media-for-35m-ceo-is-out-press-release/). Justin Timberlake also took ownership in this acquisition and will play a strong role in Myspace's future strategy and creative direction.

Prime Sense's interactive device can see, track and react to user movements outside the computer, all without change of environment or wearable equipment for the end user. The closed device is plug and play and platform independent.

IQReviewÂ® uses an Artificial Intelligence based computational procedure for duplicate bill checking. This process provides the most accurate and sophisticated method ever developed for eliminating duplicated charges of any kind.
Many companies, large and small, entrust ACS CompIQ with their medical bill review work.Â  ACS CompIQâs patented auditing process insures accuracy, screens for unnecessary services and applies the deepest network savings available. With the amazing IQReviewÂ®, our team of expert bill agents double checks every bill for accuracy.
We customize for your business work flows.Â  You can benefit from a host of services:
	â¢	Claims Software Integrationâ¦EDI
	â¢	Complex Bill Review
	â¢	Specialty and âRushâ Reviews
	â¢	Extensive Management Reports
	â¢	National and Regional Provider Networks (PPO)
	â¢	Image System Integration
ACS CompIQ will answer all provider questions and handle every re-evaluation. Our turnaround time and savings are setting the performance standard in the industry.

ACS CompIQ Corp is very successful at developing customized EDI interfaces.Â  The reality is that EVERY EDI interface is customized to a certain degree.Â  Because we have world class software developers on staff, we are comfortable with even the most advanced levels of customization.Â  Our expertise extends to a wide variety of EDI interface technologies including the latest trends in XML web services for real time data transfer.
The integration most often used for our clients begins with EDI transfer of claim and provider records from the claims management system to our bill review system.Â IQReviewÂ® captures this data and makes it available to the bill review analystâs production use.Â  Importantly, IQReviewÂ® tracks any unique identifiers used by the claims system and returns them as part of the next step, which is the EDI transfer of payments records back to the claims management system.Â  This allows the claims management system to identify internal claim and vendor records associated with each payment with 100% accuracy and no manual intervention. Â  Many organizations have a need to interface with multiple claims databases and even different claims systems simultaneously.Â IQReviewÂ® supports this requirement and automatically segments claim and vendor records so that the user is only presented with records from the appropriate claims system during production.
IQReviewÂ® interfaces with all major claims management systems such as:Â  David, David Renaissance, Risk Master, VOS, VOS Portal, Talisman, Sucaba, Pyramid, Stars, RiskCo, and Gensource.Â  As we add new clients we continually build new interfaces to client specifications.Â  The interface is provided via EDI (electronic data interface) to receive claims data and vendor data from an external system as well as transmit payment information to an external system. Payment information may include bill review fees, PPO fees and more broken down in whatever manner is appropriate to our customersâ AP system.Â  Â Additionally, IQReviewÂ® provides data to claims systems in an EDI format to allow the printing of EOR information on check stubs.Â 
EDI files can be transmitted via email, FTP, or floppy disk.Â  Information is also compliant with OLE, DB/ADO/ODBC - making it possible to work with any database engine.
ACS CompIQ can accept import data in almost any format.Â  Likewise, we can accommodate almost any format needed for export.Â  Files are usually fixed-length ASCII data.

If you login, you can see everything your twitter friends posted @jealous, so you can decide you are indeed ""jealous"" or you think the post is ""boring"". You can also leave a comment.

We just launched the website and we're still working on it. If users use the # we save the location. If you select ""spots & brands"" in the menu (not yet implemented) users can see the most popular locations or brands. Also we show the user how much they spent there and at what location (if there is a value in the post, like $59).

We are still busy with the spots & brands. This is a large item. Here we try to get the user a lot of information. Example tweet, ""I finally have my new IPhone 4 $99,- #macstore @jealous"" we know it's bought in a macstore and if there is a GPS location we know which macstore it is and that the price at this macstore is 99 dollars. (if the price is entered in euros the system automatically recalculates the value to dollars). In the spots & brands we show this post with the apple logo, a short description of the brand apple, all other post from user who used #macstore (or similar, like apple) and a total spent of all jealous users.

This success, and the desire to fund further growth, prompted the company to become listed in the Alternative Investment Market - AIM - of the London Stock Exchange. Upon admission, the company had an approximate market capitalisation of £45 million.

Cupid and its network of websites grew organically, hitting an impressive 300,000 new registered users monthly by early 2010. This growth translated itself to other platforms: in March 2011, Cupid reached 7 million users on the new Facebook platform. If this weren't enough, Cupid's mobile platforms have themselves achieved unprecedented levels of popularity, with BeNaughty's Android app achieving 1.25 million downloads in February 2011, becoming the top downloaded Android app in the USA.

The company began using the capital it obtained from floating in the stock market to supplement and expand its growth, which had happened organically, through the acquisition of companies in other markets to strengthen its overall position. The first two of these acquisitions took place in September 2010, when the company bought PlanetSappho for £200,000 and Granamor for £25,000. This increased the company's portfolio to 15 sites in total. It was around this time when EasyDate gained the license for Flirt.com. This was for an initial period of six months, time during which the company entered into an events partnership with Metro newspaper and Cosmopolitan and Men's Health magazines to promote individual dating events in London. The company purchased [Flirt.com](http://www.flirt.com) outright less than four months later, for roughly £800,000.

It was in December 2010 that the company decided to change its name to Cupid plc, following a threat of legal action from easyJet founder Si Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who wanted to avoid any confusion with his ""easy"" branding. The company opted for Cupid plc as three months earlier it had acquired Cupid.com and associated domains for £4.4 million.

Also in December 2010 the company announced a product in conjunction with WhatsOnStage.com. This was TheatreDate, a niche dating site for theatre lovers - the first of many similar collaborations.

In February 2011, the company announced the acquisition of IndianDating.com, a North American website aimed at the Indian-American market in the US and Canada, for $200,000 US (around £125,000 at the time). The acquisition gave Cupid access to IndianDating's 600,000 users at the time, but more importantly, to a potential market of 2.6 million which had grown 53% over the previous ten years  the fastest of any Asian ethnic group in the USA.

In mid-March 2011, Cupid achieved 7 million users on Facebook, having been nimble in taking advantage of the social network's platform to position itself strongly at the intersection between social networking and online dating  an advantageous spot to both reach a wider audience and provide a better service to its users. A few months after this, in May 2011, Cupid's monthly revenues were over £4 million. At this stage more than half of total revenue came from outside the UK for the first time in its history. It is at this time that the company announces the acquisition of Cupidon.com for £175,000 to improve its offering in the French
market. As part of the same strategy, the company invested £2.5 million in a 75% stake in OnlineLiebe GmbH and WomenWeb GmbH, two German websites mainly appealing to niche dating markets in German-speaking countries. The process continued in August of that year, when the company acquired several Brazilian dating sites for £500,000, which gave them a foothold in a growing market with a population of 190 million.

In October 2011 Cupid was named by Deloitte as the fastest growing technology company in Scotland, and 19th in the United Kingdom, having grown a very impressive 1,317% in five years.","online-dating, dating, speed-dating, local-dating, social-media, social-discovery, mobile-dating, dating-app",GBR,NA,Edinburgh,Edinburgh,2013-05-15,2013-05-15,1,1,NA,NA,0,0,2012-03-19,2013-01-01,2,7,onlinepersonalswatch,2008-06-16T20:16:29Z,2013-01-19T04:58:01Z,6600000

The company, founded in 2003 by [Dalton Caldwell](/person/dalton-caldwell), takes its name from ""meme"" - a term coined to describe the ideas that communities, adopt, and express.

imeem started as an instant messaging service that let people communicate through chat, blogging, instant messaging and sharing files. This model didn't pan out, and in 2006,  the company reinvented itself as a social networking site that let people discover, play and share music, music videos, and photos. 

In September 2006, imeem introduced embeddable flash playlists that gave people the ability to take music and video playlists they created (or found) on the site and embed them virtually anywhere on the web. imeemâs players quickly became popular with consumers using [MySpace](/company/myspace) and other social networks, giving them a way to customize & personalize their profiles with music. 

imeem pioneered the ad-supported streaming music model. In 2007, the company became the first-ever online music site to secure licenses from all 4 major music labels (and thousands of indie labels and artists) to offer their music catalogues for free streaming and sharing on the web.

Under this model, artists and labels are paid a share of the imeemâs ad revenue in proportion to the popularity of their music on imeem, and have the right to register their content and determine how (or whether) that content is available on the site or through its embeddable widgets.

This business model is made possible by imeem's proprietary content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. Initially, imeem licensed this technology from [SNOCAP](/company/snocap), the digital rights and content management startup founded by [Napster](/company/napster) creator [Shawn Fanning](/person/shawn-fanning). In 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP and its technology outright; as part of this acquisition, SNOCAP's COO, [Ali Aydar](/person/ali-aydar), joined imeem's executive team.

In December 2009, imeem was acquired by MySpace for $1 million.","blogs, photos, music, video, playlist",USA,CA,San Francisco,SF Bay,NA,NA,0,0,2004-09-01,2009-08-01,5,24750000,2008-10-22,2010-11-10,3,13,initial-importer,2007-11-30T12:29:23Z,2013-03-12T16:59:23Z,1000000

EqualLogics automation can help save enterprises up to 45 days per year on common storage tasks and accelerate virtual machine deployments by over 70%. On top of this with automated storage tiering and intelligent load-balancing across multiple tiers, organisations are able to achieve 50% cost savings as compared to a single Tier-1 SAN and up to 76% reduction in network complexity. And by optimising storage functions within the virtual data centre EqualLogics snapshotting and copying operations can help to boost overall performance by 4 to 6 times and accelerate tasks like provisioning virtual machines by over 70%.
