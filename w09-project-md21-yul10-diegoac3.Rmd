## Introduction

We intent to find out what makes a start-up attractive for acquisition, and what drives its acquisition price up or down.

In this study, we plan to analyze the acquisition data of more than 2000 companies from all over the world, which are founded from year 1900 to year 2014. Particulary, we have interests in exploring what factors impact the acquisition price of a company, and trying to predict the company's acquisition price using regression. The data set has 2473 rows of data.

We consider the following variable as the response variable:

| variable name | description | data scoure | data type | variable type | # of missing records |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| aquisition_price_amount | Amount paid for aquisition | acquisitions.csv | int | numerical | 0 |

We consider the following 14 variables as the potential predictor:

| variable name | description | data scoure | data type | variable type | # of missing records |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| category_code | Entity category | objects.csv | string | categorical | 475 |
| normalized_name | Normalized entity name | objects.csv | string | categorical | 0 |
| logo_width | Logo width | objects.csv | float | numerical | 0 |
| logo_height | Logo height | objects.csv | float | numerical | 0 |
| description | Description of the entity | objects.csv | string | categorical | 1380 |
| country_code | Country code | objects.csv | string | categorical | 514 |
| state_code | State code | objects.csv | string | categorical | 980 |
| city | City name | objects.csv | string | categorical | 580 |
| region | Region name | objects.csv | string | categorical | 1110 |
| investment_rounds | Number of investment round participated in | objects.csv | int | numerical | 0 |
| investment_companies | Number of companies invested in | objects.csv | int | numerical | 0 |
| milestones | Number of milestones the entity has | objects.csv | int | numerical | 0 |
| relationships | Number of relationships the entity has | objects.csv | int | numerical | 0 |
| acquired_at | Date of deal | acquisition.csv | timestamp | numerical | 0 |


### Background information of the data set

The database comes from [a Kaggle public dataset about startup investments](https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/startup-investments?select=funding_rounds.csv%29) published by Justinas Cirtautas at the end of 2019. The dataset covers more 450 thousand company information from all over the world till 2013. Among those, about 10 thousand companies acomplished their acquisition successfully, while 80% of them got 0 dollars in their acquisition.

The entire dataset provides 11 cvs file with 154 columns, which covers six aspects of the startup ecosystem including organizations, individuals, company news, funding rounds, acquisitions, and IPOs. We populated all the 11 csv files. More detials can be found in the appendix at the end of this proposal. Considering the missing data rate, we determine to focus on only two files: acquisition.csv and objects.csv.

- acquisition.csv provides the acquisition details, including the acquisition amount, currency and the deal date.
- objects.csv provides the basic company profiles, which can be used as the predictor of our study.


### Purpose statement
Venture capital investments hits 9.5 billion U.S. dollars in the internet industry in the United States, as of first quarter 2020. Other leading VC sectors in terms of investment were healthcare, and software. Inspired by the florish startup world, we want to investigate what factors can impact the company price during acquisition.

In this study, we select the price of the company for acquisition as our 'Y', the response variable. Our target is to find a set of predictors and use regression method to predict our Y. We checked all dataset and select 14 varaibles as our potential predictors. Later on we will do feature engineering to determine our X's in the regression.

Meanwhile, we also want to know some interesting questions, like, whether the company name and the logo size has any impact on the acquisition price, or how the acquisition distributed by geography.

### Loading the data into `R`
We merged two csv file to get our final database `startups.csv`. For the details in data cleaning, please refer to the Appendix at the end of the proposal.

Below is the snapshot to show we load our data into `R` successfully. We are including a subset of the columns for simplicity, because some columns have very long text entries.

```{r}
sample_data = read.csv("startups.csv")


knitr::kable(head(sample_data[, c(
  "aquisition_price_amount",
  "city",
  "funding_total_usd",
  "category_code",
  "funding_rounds",
  "milestones",
  "relationships"
)]))
```


## Methods

### Data Exploration

#### Univarite Analysis

```{r}
# read the dataset
data0 = read.csv('startups1.csv', header = TRUE)
```

First, we checked the distribution of aquisition price.
```{r}
hist(data0$aquisition_price_amount, breaks = 100)
```

As we can see from the plot above, the distrbution is highly right skewed.
Then we use the box plot to check if there is any outliers.
```{r}
boxplot(data0$aquisition_price_amount)
```

As we can see there is one record in the dataset with extremely high acquicition price. We checked the database further and found its acqusition price is 2600 billion, which equals the valuation of google and amazon. So we think this one should be an database error, we will exclude this database in our further analysis.
```{r}
data1 = data0[data0$aquisition_price_amount < 10^12,]
```
```{r}
boxplot(data1$aquisition_price_amount)
```

After excluding the error in our database, the distribution of aquisition price is still highly right skewed. We will consider the log transformation on the aquisition price.

```{r}
data1["logprice"] = apply(data1["aquisition_price_amount"],2,log)
hist(data1$logprice, breaks = 100)
boxplot(data1$logprice)
```

The distributino of log aquisition price is relatively sysmetric. From the boxplot we can still find there are many records is outside of the 1.75 IQR. But we think we can start from here to build our model.

Then we checked the precdictor in the database one by one. For category_code, this is a categorical varaible.
```{r}
summary(data1$category_code)
plot(data1$category_code, data1$logprice)
```

The records concentrated in several major levels of category_code. As for the boxplot between category_code and the response, we can find significant mean within group difference between some groups, which shows this variable has some prediction power. However, at the same time, the varaible within group is also large, which means only relying on this variable cannot lead to a accurate result. So we decided to create some dummy varaibles for the major levels of this variable and put them in our candidate predictor list.

Then we turn to the name of the company. We extract the length of the company name as a feature.
```{r}
data1["name_length"] = apply(data1["normalized_name"],2,nchar)
plot(data1$name_length, data1$logprice)
```

After check the relationship between length of the company name, we found if the company name has more than 30 characters, the acquisition price tend to decrease. so we plan to create a dummy variable, company name lenght > 30 or not, and add it to our candidate predictor list.

Then we check the logo width.
```{r}
plot(data1$logo_width, data1$logprice)
fit = lm(logprice ~ logo_width, data1)
abline(fit, col = "red")
```
For the plot we found in fact, quite amount of the logo_width is 0. Then we guess, maybe in this column, 0 means missing value. so we decide to remove that part and replot the above figure.

```{r}
sum(data1$logo_width == 0)
temp = data1[data1$logo_width > 0, ]
plot(temp$logo_width, temp$logprice)
fit = lm(logprice ~ logo_width, temp)
abline(fit, col = "red")
```

It turns out there are 502 records in total has 0 logo_width. After removing them, the relationship between logo_width and log price become not that significant. considering the maximum logo_width is more than 5000 times of the minimum width, the data reliability becomes skeptical.

We further checked the log_height.

```{r}
plot(data1$logo_height, data1$logprice)
fit = lm(logprice ~ logo_height, data1)
abline(fit, col = "red")
```
```{r}
sum(data1$logo_height == 0)
temp = data1[data1$logo_height > 0, ]
plot(temp$logo_height, temp$logprice)
fit = lm(logprice ~ logo_height, temp)
abline(fit, col = "red")
```

It show the same pattern. Out of curiosity, we create a variable named, logo_ratio, which is the ration of logo height and width.

```{r}
mask = data1$logo_height > 0
data1["logo_ratio"] = data1["logo_height"] / data1["logo_width"]
plot(data1$logo_ratio[mask], data1$logprice[mask])
fit = lm(logprice ~ logo_ratio, data1[mask,])
abline(fit, col = "red")
```

But it turns out seems this variable does not help much. Considering the data sanity issue in those columns, we did not put them to our candidate predictor list.

Then we checked the country_code, which is a categorical variable.

```{r}
summary(data1$country_code)
plot(data1$country_code, data1$logprice)
```

The records concentrated in several major levels of country_code. To be more specific, most records is in USA. As for the boxplot between country_code and the response, we can find significant mean within group difference between some groups, which shows this variable has some prediction power. However, at the same time, the varaible within group is also large, which means only relying on this variable cannot lead to a accurate result. So we decided to create some dummy varaibles for the major levels of this variable  and put them in our candidate predictor list.

The same observation found in city.

```{r}
summary(data1$city)
plot(data1$city, data1$logprice)
```

The records concentrated in several major levels of city. As for the boxplot between city_code and the response, we can find significant mean within group difference between some groups, which shows this variable has some prediction power. However, at the same time, the varaible within group is also large, which means only relying on this variable cannot lead to a accurate result. So we decided to create some dummy varaibles for the major levels of this variable  and put them in our candidate predictor list.

For investiment_rounds, we found it showed a slightly positive correlation with log price. We added it to our candidate predictor list.

```{r}
plot(data1$investment_rounds, data1$logprice)
```

For investiment_companies, we found it showed a slightly positive correlation with log price. We added it to our candidate predictor list.

```{r}
plot(data1$invested_companies, data1$logprice)
```

For milestones, we found it showed a slightly positive correlation with log price. We added it to our candidate predictor list.

```{r}
plot(data1$milestones, data1$logprice)
```

For relationships, we found it showed a slightly positive correlation with log price. We added it to our candidate predictor list.

```{r}
plot(data1$relationships, data1$logprice)
fit = lm(logprice ~ relationships, data1)
abline(fit, col = "red")
```
####  Correlation Analysis
Then we checked the correlation matrix of the numerical variables.
```{r}
data2 = data1[,c("name_length", "investment_rounds", "invested_companies", "milestones", "relationships")]
cor(data2)
```

It turns out the `investment_rounds` and `invested_companies` shows strongly collinearity. We should only use one of them in the model to avoid the collinearity issue.



### Data Adjustments

Based on the single predictor analysis above, it is now possible to further simplify the dataset that will be used to determine whether the `aquisition_price` of startups can be correlated with startup characteristics and their performance. 

Some data adjustments include:

- Collapsing of the number of levels for factor variables with a high number levels: `category_code`, `country_code`, `city`, `state_code`. This will ommit potential dummy variables when dealing with factor variables with levels that provide little significance. The fewer levels and variables also adds benefit of simplifying the model.
- Removal of columns that are not useful in the statitical analysis: `company_id`,`normalized_name`, `status`, `logo_width`, `logo_height`. These are pure descriptions of the startups, and while these could have been a source for additional continuous (e.g. word counts) or discreet variables (mention of certain trendy keywords), we decided to leave out for now to narrow down the analysis on the other variables.
- Division of the full data into 2 datasets: one for training (`startups_tr`), with  80% of the observations, and the rest will be included in a test dataset (`startups_te`), useful for model cross-validation. The split is done randomly.
- Removal of outlier case of acquisition for 2.6T. For reference, Amazon's Market Cap is 1.6T. We believe this was an input error.

train_index = sample(1:nrow(startups), size = floor(0.8 * nrow(startups)))

```

The final dataset for analysis includes the following predictors. 

```{r}
str(startups)
```


### Diagnostics and Performance Function

In order to compare models, we use a single function that runs tests on both:

- Model assumptions: Residual vs fitted and Q-Q plots, bptest and wilk-shapiro test.
- Model performance: Adjusted r-squared, AIC, BIC, leave one out cross-validation, and regression p-value.

These diagnostics functions are further used in another set of utility functions that provide a side-by-side view of the model performance across the model assumptions, performance,  model parameters and their caracteristics.

### Model building

#### Additive Models

- **All variables**

The first step of the exploration is to look at a simple additive model that contains all variables.

```{r}
#Training the model
additive_full = lm(aquisition_price_amount ~ . , data = startups_tr)

#Diagnostics and performance of the model
knitr::kable(na.omit(diagnostics_performance(additive_full)), digits = 2, caption = "Performance & Assumptions")


#Coefficients with high Variance inflation factors
knitr::kable(get_vifs(additive_full), digits = 2)

```

We can see that model assumptions are clearly violated. We also see that there are variables with a potentially large variance inflation factor. For example, it would make sense to only use investment_rounds or invested_companies, or country or state, because there can be collinearity as discussed in the data exploration section. 1.97% and 2.73% of points are considered to be outliers and to have influence respectevely. Although we can aim to reduce these, in this first exploration of different additive models it does not seem likely this values will change much.

```{r}
#Direct correlation between investment_rounds and invested_companies is close to one
cor(startups_tr$investment_rounds,startups_tr$invested_companies)

#The partial correlation coefficient is also very close to zero.
#The variation of invested_companies that is unexplained by remaining predictors shows little correlation
#with the variation of aquisition_price_amount that is not explained remaining predictors.
#Adding invested companies is of little use to the model.
model_test_invested_companies_1 = lm(invested_companies ~ .-aquisition_price_amount , data = startups_tr)
model_test_invested_companies_2 = lm(aquisition_price_amount ~ .-invested_companies , data = startups_tr)
cor(resid(model_test_invested_companies_1), resid(model_test_invested_companies_2))


```

We remove the invested_companies and state_code from the predictors and train a new model.

- **Improving collinearity**

```{r}
#Training the model
additive_full_updated = lm(aquisition_price_amount ~ .-investment_rounds -state_code , data = startups_tr)

#Diagnostics and performance of the model
knitr::kable(na.omit(diagnostics_performance(additive_full_updated)), digits = 2, caption = "Performance & Assumptions")

#Coefficients with high Variance inflation factors
knitr::kable(get_vifs(additive_full_updated), digits = 2)
```

In the plots, we can see that normality and constant variance are still suspect. We also see confirm that normality suspect due to the low shapiro-wilk test p-value, and that the constant variance is suspect due to low bp test p-value. The R squared and adjusted R squared remain somewhat similar, as well as the RMSE leave one out cross validation. But we now have less variables with a potentially large collinearity. Outlier and influential points remain somewhat similar.

- **Backwards AIC**

Now we will perform a backwards AIC search to optimize for AIC and further decrease collinearity issues.

```{r}
#Finding the model
model_additive_selected_AIC = step(additive_full_updated, trace = 0)

#Diagnostics and performance of the model
knitr::kable(diagnostics_performance(model_additive_selected_AIC), digits = 2, caption = "Performance & Assumptions")


#Coefficients with high Variance inflation factors
knitr::kable(get_vifs(model_additive_selected_AIC), digits = 2)

```

The found model still violates normality and constant variance assumptions, as would normally be expected since this is derived from a model that also violated them. However, we are able to see less predictors with a variance inflation factor higher than 5. Outlier and influential points remain similar. Now we proceed to compare both models with an anova test and decide which is the best additive model.

- **Selecting the best additive model**

```{r}
anova(model_additive_selected_AIC, additive_full_updated)
```

We can see that the larger model doesn't offer a statistically significant difference in explaining the relationship of predictors and response. For that reason, from the additive models, we prefer the model found through the backwards BIC method `model_additive_selected_AIC`. This model still violates normality and constant variance assumptions, and these will not likely be corrected or at least further improved until we look at more complex interaction models or we apply transformations to predictor or response variables (done below).

All in all, we won't be focusing on this purely additive model `model_additive_selected_AIC` because of the very low r squared and potential low power to make predictions.


#### Interaction Models

- **Two-way interactions**

We started the exploration by training a 2-way interaction model, excluding investment_rounds and state_code from the variables, due to collinearity.

We also tried to fit an overall 3-way model in a couple of ways. First, by considering all terms besides investment_rounds and  state_code, but due to computational limitations we decided to take a different approach (after 3 hours the model was not complete training yet). We also tried to fit an overall 3-way model, excluding city from the interaction terms (and adding it as a separate term on its own) to try to improve machine performance--altough this model offered a good initial R squared (~0.9) it was hard to interpret and still taxing on machine resources.

```{r}
#Training the model
interaction_model = lm(aquisition_price_amount ~ (. -investment_rounds -state_code)^2 , data = startups_tr)

#Diagnostics and performance of the model
knitr::kable(na.omit(diagnostics_performance(interaction_model)), digits = 2, caption = "Performance & Assumptions")

```

Although this model mathematically has a good R squared and adjusted R squared, the normality and constant variance assumptions are still violated. Furthermore, because there are 906 predictors, this is not an easy to understand model. We will find a simplified model doing a backwards AIC search.

- **Forward AIC**

Because the previous model has 906 predictors, we use a forward search to optimize for computational resources. We tried to follow use a BIC approach so that we optimize for reducing the number of predictors, but the resulting R squared was quite low (0.10), so we decided to continue with the AIC method.

```{r warning=FALSE}

  direction = "forward",
  trace = 0
)

#Diagnostics and performance of the model
knitr::kable(na.omit(diagnostics_performance(model_interaction_selected), digits = 2), caption = "Performance & Assumptions")

```

Although this model optimizes for AIC (it has a lower AIC than the first two-way interaction model), this model performs worse in other areas. In particular the both the R squared and adjusted R squared decreased (0.55 and 0.53 respectively). The normality and constant variance assumptions continue to be violated.

- **Selecting the best interaction model**

Although we prefer the first two-way interaction model due to its better performance, we run an anova test to check the significance of the additional parameters included on the first two-way model vs the model found via forward AIC.

```{r}
anova(model_interaction_selected, interaction_model)
```

The anova test confirms that the initial model does include predictors that are significant. The preferred interaction model is `interaction_model`.

#### Transformation Models

- **Boxcox method**

We start with using the same predictors used in the first 2-way interaction model. We use a $\lambda$ value of 0.12. Also, we apply a logarithmic transformation in the predictors funding_total_usd and relationships (+1 is added to these predictors because there are records with the value 0 which would lead to issues when applying the log transformation), as this showed an improvement in decreasing adjusted r squared and AIC.

```{r}
#Initial model, before transformation
model_transformation_boxcox_initial = lm(aquisition_price_amount ~ (. -investment_rounds -state_code)^2 + log(funding_total_usd+1) +log(relationships+1) , data = startups_tr)

#Boxcox plot
boxcox(model_transformation_boxcox_initial, plotit = TRUE, lambda = seq(0.1, 0.14, by = 0.01))

#Training the model
model_transformation_boxcox = lm((((aquisition_price_amount ^ 0.12) - 1) / 0.12) ~ (. -investment_rounds -state_code)^2 + log(funding_total_usd+1) +log(relationships+1) , data = startups_tr)

#Define the transformation functions to revert back to the units of aquisition_price
boxcox_reverse_function = function(lambda = 0.12){
  function(val){
    (val*lambda + 1)^(1/lambda)
  }
}


#Diagnostics and performance of the model
knitr::kable(na.omit(diagnostics_performance(model_transformation_boxcox, response_transform = boxcox_reverse_function(lambda = 0.12), train_actuals = startups_tr$aquisition_price_amount)), digits = 2, caption = "Performance & Assumptions")

```

Although in this model we are seeing lower r squared and adjusted r squared values than we obtained with the two-way interaction model, now the constant variance assumption has improved (we can see this both in the fitted vs residuals plot, and in the result of the bp test, which provides a p-value of 0.9997102). Normality is still suspect.

- **Forward AIC, using boxcox model as the scope**

We use the previously trained model as the full scope for a forward AIC search.

```{r warning=FALSE}
#Finding the model
model_transformation_boxcox_start = lm(((aquisition_price_amount ^ 0.12 - 1)/ 0.12) ~ 1, data = startups_tr)
model_transformation_boxcox_selected = step(
  model_transformation_boxcox_start,
  scope =
    ((aquisition_price_amount ^ 0.12 - 1)/ 0.12) ~ category_code * funding_rounds + category_code * milestones +
    category_code * aquisition_price_amount + category_code * top50pct + category_code *
    istop26_50 + category_code * country_code + category_code * city + category_code *
    invested_companies + category_code * funding_total_usd + category_code *
    relationships + category_code * top25pct + category_code * istop25 + category_code *
    name_length + funding_rounds * milestones + funding_rounds * aquisition_price_amount +
    funding_rounds * top50pct + funding_rounds * istop26_50 + funding_rounds *
    country_code + funding_rounds * city + funding_rounds * invested_companies +
    funding_rounds * funding_total_usd + funding_rounds * relationships + funding_rounds *
    top25pct + funding_rounds * istop25 + funding_rounds * name_length + milestones *
    aquisition_price_amount + milestones * top50pct + milestones * istop26_50 +

    country_code + aquisition_price_amount * city + aquisition_price_amount *
    invested_companies + aquisition_price_amount * funding_total_usd + aquisition_price_amount *
    relationships + aquisition_price_amount * top25pct + aquisition_price_amount *
    istop25 + aquisition_price_amount * name_length + top50pct * istop26_50 +
    top50pct * country_code + top50pct * city + top50pct * invested_companies +
    top50pct * funding_total_usd + top50pct * relationships + top50pct * top25pct +
    top50pct * istop25 + top50pct * name_length + istop26_50 * country_code +
    istop26_50 * city + istop26_50 * invested_companies + istop26_50 * funding_total_usd +
    istop26_50 * relationships + istop26_50 * top25pct + istop26_50 * istop25 +
    istop26_50 * name_length + country_code * city + country_code * invested_companies +
    country_code * funding_total_usd + country_code * relationships + country_code *
    top25pct + country_code * istop25 + country_code * name_length + city *
    invested_companies + city * funding_total_usd + city * relationships + city *
    top25pct + city * istop25 + city * name_length + invested_companies * funding_total_usd +
    invested_companies * relationships + invested_companies * top25pct + invested_companies *
    istop25 + invested_companies * name_length + funding_total_usd * relationships +
    funding_total_usd * top25pct + funding_total_usd * istop25 + funding_total_usd *
    name_length + relationships * top25pct + relationships * istop25 + relationships *
    name_length + top25pct * istop25 + top25pct * name_length + istop25 * name_length +
    log(funding_total_usd + 1) + log(relationships + 1),
  direction = "forward",
  trace = 0
)

#Diagnostics and performance of the model
knitr::kable(na.omit(diagnostics_performance(model_transformation_boxcox_selected, response_transform = boxcox_reverse_function(lambda = 0.12), train_actuals = startups_tr$aquisition_price_amount)), digits = 2, caption = "Performance & Assumptions")
```

The model shows a significant improvement in performance (adjusted r squared, AIC, BIC) but the constant variance assumption is violated again. For this reason, we still prefer the original boxcox model `model_transformation_boxcox`.

We also try to remove influential points, just to compare what would happen with the model performance and assumptions.

```{r}
## Evaluate whether removing influential observations helps on the model assumption and fit.
knitr::kable(compare_without_influential(model_transformation_boxcox_selected, train_data = startups_tr, test_data = startups_te, test_actuals_col = "aquisition_price_amount", response_transform = boxcox_reverse_function(lambda = 0.12)), digits = 2)
```

We can see that there are not significant changes in r squared, adjusted r squared, and in model assumptions (bptest and wilk-shapiro test). Test RMSE is actually worse for a theoretical model without influential values. All in all, we still prefer the original boxcox model `model_transformation_boxcox`.

- **Logarithmic transformation in response**

We also explore using a logarithmic transformation in the response variable, using the same predictors originally used for the first model fitted with the boxcox method above.

```{r}
#Training the model
model_transformation_log = lm(log(aquisition_price_amount) ~ (. -investment_rounds -state_code)^2 + log(funding_total_usd+1) +log(relationships+1) , data = startups_tr)

#Diagnostics and performance of the model
knitr::kable(na.omit(diagnostics_performance(model_transformation_log, response_transform = exp, train_actuals = startups_tr$aquisition_price_amount)), digits = 2, caption = "Performance & Assumptions")

```

In R squared and in predicted R squared this model performs marginally worse than the boxcox model, and the constant variance assumption doesn't seem suspect from the bp test (although we can see it's not fully met either from the fitted vs residuals plot). However, in AIC and in BIC, this model shows a more significant drop in performance (drop from 3274 to 3931 in AIC and from 7070 to 7727 in BIC). For that reason we prefer the boxcox model `model_transformation_boxcox` as a transformation-based model

- **Forward AIC, using lorarigthmic model as the scope**

We also use the previously trained log model as the full scope for a forward AIC search.

```{r}
#Finding the model
model_transformation_log_start = lm(log(aquisition_price_amount) ~ 1, data = startups_tr)
model_transformation_log_selected = step(
  model_transformation_log_start,
  scope =

    category_code * aquisition_price_amount + category_code * top50pct + category_code *

    log(funding_total_usd + 1) + log(relationships + 1),
  direction = "forward",
  trace = 0
)

#Diagnostics and performance of the model
knitr::kable(na.omit(diagnostics_performance(model_transformation_log_selected, response_transform = exp, train_actuals = startups_tr$aquisition_price_amount)), digits = 2, caption = "Performance & Assumptions")
```

Although this model shows improvements in AIC and BIC, other metrics do not look as good. And the constant variance assumption is more suspect now. For that reason the original logarithmic model `model_transformation_log` seems better, and overall, we still prefer the original boxcox model `model_transformation_boxcox` as a transformation-based model.

#### Summary

In summary, the two preferred models are: `interaction_model` (interaction), `model_transformation_boxcox` (transformation). We are omitting `model_additive_selected_AIC` (additive) because of its low r squared.

## Discussion

Throughout this excercise we have seen that building a model is part art and part science. There are several aspects and trade-offs to be considered, including but not limited to: model assumptions, model prediction capabilities, how easy to understand the model is (inference), and actual computational power (some attempted routes were ultimately not successful due to computational limitations).

Due to the complex relationships between predictors and response in this dataset, settling on a simple additive model was not enough and we had to fit models with interaction terms and transformations that are not as intuitive to understand but that could improve the models prediction capabilities. Although both models have more than 650 predictors, we made an attempt at drawing inferential conclusions and validate if some of the variables one would intuitively associate with the acquisition price of a startup are actually significant.

### Interaction model

The top most significant predictors in the interaction model are not very easy to understand. We can still see that predictors that look intuitively useful like `invested_companies` (number of companies that invested in the start up before) and `istop25` (one of the founders came from a top 25 university) do appear in some of the top interaction terms.

```{r}
#Most statistically significant terms in the interaction model
order_coeff_interaction = summary(interaction_model)$coefficients[order(summary(interaction_model)$coefficients[, 4]), ]
top_coeff_interaction = cbind(b_estimate = order_coeff_interaction[1:5,1], p_value = order_coeff_interaction[1:5,4])
row.names(top_coeff_interaction) = row.names(top_coeff_interaction[1:5,])
top_coeff_interaction
```

However, if we check interesting terms that seem useful (`invested_companies`, `istop25`, and `funding_total_usd`) independently we can see that they do not appear significant. And although `funding_total_usd` has a positive estimate (ie. the higher the funding in dollars, the higher the acquisition price), both `invested_companies` and `istop25` have a negative estimate (the more companies invested on a startup the lesser the acquistion price, and having a founder from a top25 university also decreases acquisition price in this model).

```{r}
#Test for significant of interesting predictors
#funding_total_usd
funding_total_estimate_int = summary(interaction_model)$coefficients[rownames(summary(interaction_model)$coefficients)=="funding_total_usd",c(1,4)]

#invested_companies
invested_companies_estimate_int = summary(interaction_model)$coefficients[rownames(summary(interaction_model)$coefficients)=="invested_companies",c(1,4)]

#istop25
istop25_estimate_int = 
summary(interaction_model)$coefficients[rownames(summary(interaction_model)$coefficients)=="istop25",c(1,4)]

results_int = rbind(funding_total_estimate_int, invested_companies_estimate_int, istop25_estimate_int)

#Results
knitr::kable(results_int)
```


### Boxcox model

Some of the most significant predictors in the boxcox model also consist of interactions that are not as easy to explain. However, we do see two predictors that are straightforward: log(relationships) and country_codeFRA, and they both have a positive estimate. This is roughly predicting that the more relationships the startup has built, and that if the startup is based in France, the higher the acquisition price.

```{r}
#Most statistically significant terms in the boxcox model
order_coeff_boxcox = summary(model_transformation_boxcox)$coefficients[order(summary(model_transformation_boxcox)$coefficients[, 4]), ]
top_coeff_boxcox = cbind(b_estimate = order_coeff_boxcox[1:5,1], p_value = order_coeff_boxcox[1:5,4])
row.names(top_coeff_boxcox) = row.names(top_coeff_boxcox[1:5,])
top_coeff_boxcox
```

On the flip side, interesting predictors (`invested_companies`, `istop25`, and `funding_total_usd`) continue to not offer a statistically significant explanation for startup acquisition price in this model. And both `invested_companies` and `istop25` continue to have a negative estimate.

```{r}
#Test for significant of interesting predictors
#funding_total_usd
funding_total_estimate_bc = summary(model_transformation_boxcox)$coefficients[rownames(summary(model_transformation_boxcox)$coefficients)=="funding_total_usd",c(1,4)]

#invested_companies
invested_companies_estimate_bc = summary(model_transformation_boxcox)$coefficients[rownames(summary(model_transformation_boxcox)$coefficients)=="invested_companies",c(1,4)]

#istop25
istop25_estimate_bc = 
summary(model_transformation_boxcox)$coefficients[rownames(summary(model_transformation_boxcox)$coefficients)=="istop25",c(1,4)]

results_bc = rbind(funding_total_estimate_bc, invested_companies_estimate_bc, istop25_estimate_bc)

#Results
knitr::kable(results_bc)
```

### Summary

*"It’s Difficult to Make Predictions, Especially About the Future"*

What started with an idea to produce an easy to understand model to predict startup acquisition price resulted in a complex excercise. This involved data wrangling, data engineering and spotting wrong data inputs, building models while considering tradeofffs, and understanding and evaluating the performance of different models.

Predictors we thought could offer a good explanation for the acquisition price of a startup did not seem to be significant in the end. And interesting predictors, such as the startup country of origin (in particular, France), resulted having an impact that seems to be significant in explaning the startup price. We also saw the importance of having a well-balanced and complete data set. Through training the models and evaluating their performance we noticed that it is hard to make predictions if the data is not good enough or if we are making predictions that are an extrapolation.

Identify specific categorical variables instead of having all of the variables in the data. This could have further improved the models while simplifying them.

## Appendix: Data Pre-cleaning

### Data load 

The startup data comes from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/startup-investments]

This dataset contains information about the startup ecosystem: organizations, individuals, company news, funding rounds, acquisitions, and IPOs, extracted originally from the Crunchabse Data website. In this project, only 6 of the 11 tables will be used and joined using unique IDs. 

- **People Data Loading:**

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

library(readr)

#People
people = read_csv("./people.csv")
colnames(people)[2] = "person_id"
attr(people, "spec") = NULL
colnames(people)

```


- **People Education Data Loading:**


```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

degrees = read_csv("./degrees.csv")
colnames(degrees)[2] = "person_id"
attr(degrees, "spec") = NULL
colnames(degrees)

```


- **Companies Data Loading:**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#Company
companies = read_csv("./objects.csv")
attr(companies, "spec") = NULL
attr(companies, "problems") = NULL
colnames(companies)[1] = "company_id"
colnames(companies)
```


- **People/Company Relationship Data Loading:**

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
comp_peep = read_csv("./relationships.csv")
colnames(comp_peep)[3] = "person_id"
colnames(comp_peep)[4] = "company_id"
colnames(comp_peep)
attr(comp_peep, "spec") = NULL
#str(comp_peep)
```



- **Company Aquisition Data Loading:**


```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
aquisitions = read_csv("./acquisitions.csv")
colnames(aquisitions)[4] = "company_id"
colnames(aquisitions)[6] = "aquisition_price_amount"
attr(aquisitions, "spec") = NULL
colnames(aquisitions)

#Filter out companies with aquisition amount not in USD (all other variable/predictors are in USD)
aquisitions = aquisitions[aquisitions$price_currency_code == "USD",c("company_id", "aquisition_price_amount")]
```



### Data Preparation

After loading the individual tables, we need to join all into a single dataset that can be used for analysis. 

#### Company Founders

The people, degrees and their relationship to the companies can all be joined into a sigle people dimension table. Additionally, we can extract potential relevant predictors for regression. For every person, generally an executive, we identify in each company people that attended to any of the top 25 or top 50 universities in the world ("top 50" excludes the top 25 universities). Also, we count the number of people in each company as well as the count of people by company that attended the top 25 and top 50 universities. Finally, to normalize these numbers, we also additional columns that represent percentage of people in each company that attended the top 25 and top 50 universities.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Auxiliary functions to count rows for analysis of data
count_disticts = function(x){
  length(unique(x))
}
counts = function(x){
  length(x)
}

#Join people with their degrees information and with which company these people belong to.
full_peep = merge(people, degrees, by="person_id")
founders = merge(full_peep, comp_peep, by="person_id")

top1 = grep(".*University of Oxford.*|.*xford.*|.*California Institute of Technology.*|.*altech|.*University of Cambridge.*|.*ambridge.*|.*Stanford University.*|.*tanford.*|.*Massachusetts Institute of Technology.*|.*MIT.*|.*Princeton University.*|.*inceton.*|.*Harvard University.*| .*arvard#|.*Yale University.*|.*Yale.*|.*University of Chicago.*|.*Imperial College London.*|.*University of Pennsylvania.*|.*Johns Hopkins University.*|.*University of California Berkeley.*|.*Berkley.*|.*ETH Zurich.*|.*UCL.*|.*Columbia University.*|.*Columbia.*|.*University of California Los Angeles.*|.*University of Toronto.*|.*Cornell University.*|.*Cornell.*|.*Duke University.*|.*University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.*|.*Northwestern University.*|.*Tsinghua University.*|.*Peking University.*|.*National University of Singapore.*", ignore.case = TRUE, x = founders$institution)

top2 = grep(".*University of Washington.*|.*Carnegie Mellon University.*|.*Carnegie.*|.*London School of Economics and Political Science.*|.*LSE.*|.*New York University.*|.*University of Edinburgh.*|.*University of California San Diego.*|.*LMU Munich LMU.*|.*University of Melbourne.*|.*University of British Columbia.*|.*University of Hong Kong.*|.*King’s College London Kings College London.*|.*The University of Tokyo.*|.*École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.*|.*Lausanne.*|.*Georgia Institute of Technology.*|.*University of Texas at Austin.*|.*Karolinska Institute.*|.*McGill University.*|.*Technical University of Munich.*|.*Heidelberg University.*|.*KU Leuven.*|.*Paris Sciences et Lettres – PSL Research University Paris.*|.*PSL.*|.*The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.*|.*University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.*|.*University of Illinois.*|.*Urbana-Champaign.*|.*Urbana.*|.*Champaign.*|.*Nanyang Technological University .*|.*Australian National University.*", ignore.case = TRUE, x = founders$institution)

top25 = rep(0, nrow(founders))
top50 = rep(0, nrow(founders))
top25[top1] = 1
top50[top2] = 1
founders["top25"] = top25
founders["top50"] = top50
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
founders = aggregate(x = founders[,c("top25", "top50")], by = list(company_id = founders$company_id, person_id = founders$person_id), FUN = max)
peeps = aggregate(x = founders[,c("company_id", "person_id")], by = list(company_id = founders$company_id), FUN = counts)
peeps = peeps[,c(1,2)]
colnames(peeps)[2] = "people"
founders = aggregate(x = founders[,c("top25", "top50")], by = list(company_id = founders$company_id), FUN = sum)
founders = merge(founders, peeps[,c(1,2)], by="company_id")
founders$top25pct = round(100*founders$top25/founders$people)
founders$top50pct = round(100*founders$top50/founders$people)
founders = na.omit(founders[,-c(2,3,4)])

```


### Final Dataset For Analysis

After extracting the individual data aspects (people, company, investments) of the companies, these aspects are joined into a single dataset. The dataset that will be used for this project will depend on the resulting row numbers after different combination of joins.

```{r eval=FALSE}
company_aq = merge(companies, aquisitions, by = "company_id")
#nrow(company_aq)
company_aq_lds = merge(x = company_aq, y = founders, by = "company_id", all.x = TRUE)
#nrow(company_aq_lds)

```

### Preminiary Analysis

To ensure that the dataset is viable for linear regression analysis, we create a preliminary linear model with company aquisition price as the response variable, and several other potential columns in the startups dataset as predictors. We are using the `company_aq` dataset above.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Data set to be analized, filtering out aquisition values without aquisition price
startups = company_aq_lds[company_aq_lds$aquisition_price_amount>0, ]
nrow(startups)
col_remove = c("entity_type", "entity_id", "parent_id", "name", "permalink", "founded_at", "closed_at", "domain", "homepage_url", "twitter_username", "logo_url", "short_description", "description", "overview", "tag_list", "region", "first_investment_at", "last_investment_at", "first_funding_at", "last_funding_at", "first_milestone_at", "last_milestone_at", "created_by", "created_at", "updated_at")

startups = startups[,-which(colnames(startups) %in% col_remove)]

#Nulls by column
show_nas = function(somedf){
  cols_nas = data.frame(column = colnames(somedf), numNAs = rep(0, ncol(somedf)))
  for(i in 1:ncol(somedf)){
    cols_nas[i, "numNAs"] = length(somedf[is.na(somedf[,i]),i])
  }
  cols_nas$pctNAs = round(100*cols_nas$numNAs / nrow(somedf), digits = 1)
  cols_nas
}
show_nas(startups)

```

We clean `NA` values below:
```{r eval=FALSE}

#clean NAs; introduce "Unknown" for categorical variables where ther are N/As
startups[is.na(startups[,"category_code"]),"category_code"] = "unknown"
startups[is.na(startups[,"country_code"]),"country_code"] = "unknown"
startups[is.na(startups[,"city"]),"city"] = "unknown"
startups[is.na(startups[,"state_code"]),"state_code"] = "unknown"

#For numeric variablestop25pct, top50pct; will convert all of these into a categorical variable that says if people in company attended universities in top 25 universities in worl, then 1. Similarly, if company people (executives), attended universites in the top 26 to 50 universites `istop26_50`, 1; else, 0.
startups[is.na(startups[,"top25pct"]),"top25pct"] = 0
startups[is.na(startups[,"top50pct"]),"top50pct"] = 0
startups$istop25 = ifelse(startups$top25pct > 0, 1, 0)
startups$istop26_50 = ifelse(startups$top50pct > 0, 1, 0)

#Add a few additional predictors
startups$name_length = nchar(startups$normalized_name)

show_nas(startups)
```

With clean data, we can now perform the data split for training and data

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Generate the full data
write_csv(x = startups, path = "./startups.csv")

set.seed(420)
train_index = sample(1:nrow(startups), size = floor(0.8 * nrow(startups)))
startups_tr = startups[train_index,]
startups_te = startups[-train_index,]

#Save the train and test datasest
write_csv(x = startups_tr, path = "./startups_tr.csv")
write_csv(x = startups_te, path = "./startups_te.csv")
```


The dataset to be used, `startups` has `r nrow(startups)` rows of data.

A sample output of the data is below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Sample out
knitr::kable(head(startups[, c(
  "aquisition_price_amount",
  "city",
  "funding_total_usd",
  "category_code",
  "funding_rounds",
  "milestones",
  "relationships"
)]))
```

Moreover, a very simple model illustrates feasibility for linear regression analysis:

```{r}
#Linear Model
company_model = lm(log(aquisition_price_amount) ~ log(funding_total_usd+1) + category_code + funding_rounds + milestones + relationships + istop25 + istop26_50, data=startups)
summary(company_model)
```

- $R^2= `r summary(company_model)$r.squared`$
- $\text{p-value} = `r pf(summary(company_model)$fstatistic[1], summary(company_model)$fstatistic[2], summary(company_model)$fstatistic[3], lower.tail=FALSE)`$

In addition, we can see how the linear regression assumptions of normality and constant variance are with the simple model. In the study, will better adjust tthe model in question to more appropriately describe the data with the model including its variance.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Plots of the model
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(company_model, which = 1:2)
```
