# Data Preparation

## Company Founders


This joins the people, degrees and their relationship to the companies. Also,this section "normalizes" the data, particularly the discreet data, so it can be used for regression.

```{r}
full_peep = merge(people, degrees, by="person_id")
str(full_peep)
```

```{r }
#join people with comp_peeps
founders = merge(full_peep, comp_peep, by="person_id")
str(founders)
#View(founders)
```

```{r}

#titles = unique(founders$title)
#View(titles)
#subjects = unique(founders$subject)
#institutions = unique(founders$institution)
#c = unique(founders$company_id)
#deg = unique(founders$degree_type)

#length(titles)
